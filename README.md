# DRR-06-Weather-App

## Description
This assignment had me build a Weather Dashboard App where one can search for a city and bring up current weather and a 5 day forecast. We utilized the get method from a web based API that allows us to search for data and retrieve specific data using a provided URL inserting the user inputs of City and State into the URL. This then retrieves that city's weather data - current and 5 day forecast. The app utilizes bootstrap for displaying the info on the html deployed page. It also stores the previous searches and creates a button for each that can be recalled from a press of the button - replacing the fields on the page.
